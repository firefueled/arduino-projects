# LowLightSensor

A low light sensor that activates a relay whenever low light is detected. A night lamp, if you will...
There's an alternative version for use with an LDR instead of a light sensor module.
The LDR seems to be more robust against the external forces of nature.
The container obviously needs to have a hole in it for the light sensor to do it's job.
Make sure to double seal it to protect the innards from water, and regularly check it for UV light degradation.
